  <H2> Life in Bellflower, California </H2>
<p> Ali Shaikh was born on November 28, 1997 in Bellflower, California to a Pakistani Muslim
family. Bellflower, California is located somewhere near Los Angeles. His first few years
were spent in a small apartment with his aunt, uncle, mom and maternal grandmother. In general,
Los Angeles was like a luxury with Hollywood Sign, Beverly Hills, and mountains behind the city
skyline was a beautiful scenary. In his childhood, he taught he should come back in his adulthood whether
for internship or visit his old house. </p>

  <H2> Life in Walnut Creek and Contra Costa County, California </H2>
  <p> After Ali moved out of Los Angeles, Ali's mom and himself along with aunt and uncle moved to
      somewhere between Walnut Creek and San Francisco. These cities in Northern California
      are beautiful with Golden Gate Bridge, Yosemite National Park, and other beautiful landmarks
      like San Francisco Cable Cars and San Francisco Bay Bridge. Life in Northern California he found
      as a child was same thing luxurious but healthier than smog polluted Los Angeles. He and his family
      would go out for a drive back and forth whether if it is Los Angeles or Sacramento. By 2002,
      his family condition went from good to bad to worse when his maternal grandmother fell ill and passed away.
      This condition prompted Ali's mom and him to leave for Houston,TX but they would come back later for his maternal uncle's wedding.
      Later, in his high school year, he would be back to visit not only Walnut Creek but San Francisco, Berkeley
      and Oakland to view more of landmarks. </p>
